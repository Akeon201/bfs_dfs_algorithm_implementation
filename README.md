#### Author: Kenyon Leblanc
This README will guide you through setting up and using the program.

## Setup

    1. You must have Python3 installed.
    2. Ensure you are in the same file directory as the main.py file.

## Interactive Mode

    1. Run the command "python3 ./main.py" to run the program.
    2. You will be prompted for a file name. Make sure to include the extension i.e. "BFS_DFS.csv"
    3. You will be prompted for a star node. This will be the node you want to start at.
    4. You will be prompted for an end node. This will be the node you want to search for.
    5. If inputs are valid, the results from both searches will display in the terminal window.

## Notes

    If invalid input is detected, the user will be prompted to try another input.
